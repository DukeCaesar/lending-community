 A lending community where interest income are distributed among community members

 The interests generated from loans are distributed among community memers.
 When interests are paid by borrowers, first a small percentage is deducted and this money will goes directly to the provisional funds, which will be used to cover bad and doubtful loans. Then the interests will be distributed among community members based on each member's investment share.

 The investment share for any member is calculated by dividing member's balance by the aggregate sum.

 There is a small pitful of this method: malicious members could deposit a tremendous amount of money before the interest payback day, therefore expanding their investment shares greatly and encroaching interests income of other righteous members. After the interests income are calculated based on investment shares and distributed, these malicious members withdraw their money back. These behaviours are impossible to prevent.

 One solution is to lock the deposit for a fixed period of time (for instance, one day or one week) before it can be withdrawn. During the locked-up time, there is the possibility that the huge investment may be lent out, and these malicious interest skimmers are facing the risk that they may not be able to withdraw their money back after the interest distribution, as there is not enough fund left in the vault. This could act as a deterrent to these behaviours. Therefore the lock-up time for deposit shall be long enough to accommodate the loan approval process.
